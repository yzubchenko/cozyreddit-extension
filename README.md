Improves Reddit usability and highlights new comments (with sync)

INSTRUCTIONS:
---
 Because of Terms of Service, I can't make storage API requests public,
 but you can use your storage to keep extension data.
 Therefore you need to implement some functions with requests to your storage.
 
 '/chrome/cozy_reddit_persistence.js' file presents a stub for functions, which you need to implement.
 For each function, a detailed description has been written.
 
 As storage you can use eg.: parse.com, firebase.com or some other.
 
NOTE:
---
 If you want to use any additional scripts, you should add them to [manifest.json]
